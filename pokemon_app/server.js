});

// Render your individual pokemon in the show view
// copy/paste your code from your index.ejs into your show.ejs (surely, there must be a better way; are you wondering if there is something in the hungry for more section about this?)
// change all your html code inside your show.ejs file's <body> so that
// your h1 tag says "Gotta Catch 'Em All"
// add an h2 tag that will display the name of the pokemon
// add an image tag that will display an image of the pokemon
// add an anchor tag with the text of back, that will take you back to your index.ejs view
// update the route in the server.js to render the show view with the pokemon data
// ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:
// "Commit 9 - created show views of each pokemon "
